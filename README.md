Virtualized web3 development environment for Ethereum

This repository was created to help developers get up and running with ethereum environments and tools.  

### scripts 

The scripts folder contains the procedural, host configuration files for installing web3, ethereum, and various other host tools and software.

In order to test our web3 project against the Ethereum testnets or mainnet we need a full or light node. The scripts/syncgeth.sh script will connect to the Ropsten testnet in "light" mode. In light mode your node is only syncing a small, recent, portion of the blockchain. This can be useful if you are only running tests or developing.  

Currently I have configured geth to run in `screen`, this is a linux hack of sorts and plans are underway to trasnition to a system service.
